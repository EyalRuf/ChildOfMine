To make the example work:
- Go to Assets -> CardboardCore -> Pooling -> Runtime -> Demo -> Configs in your project and select the DemoPoolConfig asset
- Check the "Addressable" tick and name it "DemoPoolConfig"
- Run the PoolingDemo scene found in Assets -> CardboardCore -> Pooling -> Runtime -> Demo -> Scenes
- Press "1" to pop a cube from a pool
- Press "2" to pop a sphere from a pool
- Press "backspace" to push all cubes and spheres back in the pool
